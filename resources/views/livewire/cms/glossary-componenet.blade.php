                 <p>2nd charge loans are often used when the interest rate environment has moved up from the time of the 1st property loan.</p>
                 <p>Take, for example, Daniel took up a $700,000 loan on his property worth 1 million with ABC bank some years ago at 2% p.a with just $300,000 outstanding now. Interest rates have fallen below that of that the 1st loan and Daniel can by refinancing with another bank at 1%, enjoy a lower rate for his current outstanding or he can gear up and borrow all $700,000 for cash flow purposes.</p>
                <p> But if interest rates have risen - instead of gearing up and borrowing $700,000 and having to pay a higher interest, he could take a 2nd bank loan of only $400,000 while he still services the $300,000 outstanding with the 1st bank at a lower rate concurrently. The secondary lender places a lien/caveat on the property to protect its interests and it is called a second charge because the lender is second in line after the primary mortgage lender. The term “caveat” is a Latin term that translates to “let him beware”. It acts as a warning for third parties that the lodging party, known as the “Caveator”, has an interest in the property/land. A caveat may prevent the owner of the land from transferring, selling the asset without the prior consent of the Caveator.</p>
                <p>2nd charge loan is also used when cashflow is required only for a short period, such as a few months to a year, when the 1st loan is still locked-in, or when the borrower has very bad credit.</p>
